# Project Title: Plagiarism Checker in Python

In this code, I define two functions: similarity and check_plagiarism.

The similarity function takes texts as input and uses the SequenceMatcher class from the difflib library to calculate the similarity ratio between the text. The ratio represents the similarity between the texts, ranging from 0 to 1.

The check_plagiarism function takes file paths as input and reads the contents of the file. It then calls similarity to calculate the similarity ratio between the texts. If the similarity ratio is greater than or equal to a specified threshold (default is 0.8), it prints a plagiarism message. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating no plagiarism is detected.

In the main section, you need to specify the file path for the text files you want to compare . You can adjust the threshold value as needed.

To use this plagiarism checker, save the code in a file (e.g., plagiarism.py) and make sure you have the files text1.txt and user_file.txt in the same directory. Replace the file paths in the main section with the paths to your desired text files. Then, you can run the script using python plagiarism_checker.py, and it will output the similarity ratio and plagiarism detection result based on the specified threshold.
